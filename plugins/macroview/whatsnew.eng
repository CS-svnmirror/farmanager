   FAR key combination "Ctrl-." in all Windows versions.

                      folder;

   area dividers between different areas in the macro list. By default this
   option is turned on.

   throughout the screen and hide by Ctrl-Alt-Shift keystroke.

 ! Bug with opening of some macro entries.


 VI: New in version 2.0.
 -----------------------
 + The main feature of this version: user can press Ctrl-. in the insert/edit
   dialog that allows to input macro combinations known by FAR and used for
   macro commands. Second press of Ctrl-. will stop token writing and begin
   normal input processing. Hint: NT and 2000 only!

 + New option in configuration dialog: user can configure cycle cursor movement
   in macro commands list.

   to another configuration not properly displayed.

 ------------------------
 + Now you can copy or move macro commands to any of existing FAR configuration,
   using F7 and F8 keys accordingly.

 + To easily understand macro command's work place, you can display macro
   areas in more readable way, i.e. group names where macro command belongs
   to, "tell" you its real long names.

 + Setting up start-dependent sorting in macro list (i.e. in file panels first
   will come macro commands belongs to "Shell" area, in editor first will
   come "Editor" area, and so on).

 + You can now set displaying of hot keys in macro list on or off.
   (This hot keys in some rare situations and big macro commands amount
   "freeze" some of the keyboard keys).

 * Saving macro command to file now supports folder creating both on local
   and network drives ("UNC" paths), i.e. you may save macro command to
   "dir1\dir2\dir3\macro.reg" even if these "dir1\dir2\dir3" does not exists.

 * Now "Show only "Shell" area in file panel" is renamed to "Show &all except
   "Viewer" and "Editor" areas in panels" and will also, in case of setting
   this option on, display all macro commands except "Viewer" and "Editor"
   areas.

 * When macro list is empty, pressing F4 or Enter will not now close plugin.

 ! Macro had not been properly saved when changed: command of execution,
   macro area, key combination for macro, and description simultaneously.

 ! Export of macro to file, whose name contains Cyrillic letters, had lead to
   disk errors, and no file creation occurs.

 ! Copying (and moving) macro to another area where the same macro exists,
   but is switched off.
