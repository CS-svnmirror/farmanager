Upgrade existing version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  1. Upgrading using a full package

  If you receive full package simply delete all old files from FTP directory
(including subdirectories) and extract received package to old directory;

  2. Upgrading using a partial package

  If you receive partial package, be sure you have all other files from
correct version of plugin package;

  Upgrading using partial packages are safe only in case if:
    - you periodically receive new versions;
    - you have the last full plugin package installed;
    - you are a bug-reporter and receive plugin package directly from developer;
    - you know exactly what you are doing;

  Always read next files before installing:
    - Check changes in all text files from package;

  You should overwrite next files if they are contained in the package:
      - *.dll - FTP client or plugins files;
                Client may not run or may fail if you use it with sub-plugins
                from different versions;
      - *.lng - language files.
                Plugin will fail showing message if you use old language files;
      - all other files are optional;
